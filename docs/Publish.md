# Publish Repositories and Mirrors
<div>

Publish snapshot or local repo as Debian repository to be used as APT source on Debian based systems.

The published repository is signed with the user's GnuPG key.

Repositories can be published to local directories, Amazon S3 buckets, Azure or Swift Storage.

#### GPG Keys

GPG key is required to sign any published repository. The key pari should be generated before publishing.

Publi—Å part of the key should be exported from your keyring using `gpg --export --armor` and imported on the system which uses a published repository.

#### Parameters

Publish APIs use following convention to identify published repositories: `/api/publish/:prefix/:distribution`.  `:distribution` is distribution name, while `:prefix` is `[<storage>:]<prefix>` (storage is optional, it defaults to empty string), if publishing prefix contains slashes `/`, they should be replaced with underscores (`_`) and underscores
should be replaced with double underscore (`__`). To specify root `:prefix`, use `:.`, as `.` is ambigious in URLs.
